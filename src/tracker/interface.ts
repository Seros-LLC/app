/**
 * The tracker boundary.
 *
 * v0 writes to exactly one tracker (business/archive/saas-2026-08/ROADMAP.md, "Tracker write"). This
 * interface exists so the choice is configuration rather than a code change, and
 * so the worker can be tested without a network.
 *
 * The contract the worker relies on:
 *   - `write` either returns an external id and url, or throws. It never returns
 *     success without an id, because `tasks.write_state='created'` is set from
 *     that answer and must mean the issue exists.
 *   - `write` is called at most once per task under a claim, and carries an
 *     `idempotencyKey` so an adapter can recognise its own earlier attempt after
 *     a timeout that actually succeeded upstream.
